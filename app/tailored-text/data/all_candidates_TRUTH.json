She believes in the future of the company and so making all our jobs meaningful. With her open character she builds up trust. She built up a team of us GMP auditors what is not easy. We feel that she is willing to take a courageous stand. With all that, we did not need to care about any internal politics. Sarbary showed a sincere interest in us auditors and the solutions to our problems. As she did herself some audits together with us, she understood very well the issues in auditing and was aware of our strong and weak sides. With her auditing she provides a positive example; \"walks the talk\" – not only asking but also delivering to our targets. As she doesn’t micromanage we are also much more productive.\nShe organized some good short trainings during our monthly calls. This is essential to keep up with projects in the company and compensates somewhat for the limited training budget. During the meetings, she encouraged open dialog what was again good for team building. Nevertheless, she makes effective use of discretionary time and the meeting stayed short.\nShe effectively puts plans into action. We get in a short time a decision on plan changes and with this planning, is less cumbersome and better accepted by the sites.\nIt was great to have her as my last boss before retiring from Novartis. Thank you.\n",

Sabari and I worked together at Novartis for a few years and I was impressed with her organizational skills and “can-do” attitude. She aptly managed the Novartis GMP Corporate audit plan each year we were together and exceeded the vast majority of her goals. I was equally impressed with her managerial and leadership abilities. She led a staff of highly seasoned, veteran auditors who conducted audits across the globe. Through her leadership, she and the audit team were able to uncover opportunities for improvement that helped ensure the product being produced was safe and effective; the patient received a fit-for-use product and the company was fully compliant with all of the global laws and regs (in each of the several hundred countries where NVS marketed products). In summary, any company would benefit from Sarbari’s knowledge and skills. ",

Sarbari has a very positive “can-do” attitude and builds effective working relationships with her colleagues and other organizations she works with. \n\nDuring a major organizational change, Sarbari took on the leadership of a new group and worked tenaciously to define and deliver a clear set of goals. Later she made a major decision to switch to Novartis Switzerland. The skills highlighted earlier allowed her to make the adjustment to a new environment.\n\nSarbari brings and applies a unique combination of technical and personal skills. In particular, Sarbari delegates tasks to her subordinates in an effective way, giving them clear responsibility for delivery while providing coaching and mentoring support. \n",

She is generous in supplying new ideas and perspectives, and is a attentive listener to alternate viewpoints.

      "description": "Philip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. As of September 30, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 82 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 19.7 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products account for approximately 36.2% of PMI’s total third-quarter 2023 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences. For more information, please visit www.pmi.com and www.pmiscience.com.\n\nOur priority is to attract, support and keep with us diverse and unique individuals.

In turn, these attributes rub off on other team members who respond accordingly. Carl is extremely knowledgeable on the Quality subject matter and is able to articulate the knowledge to the uninitiated in a \"user friendly\" way - he is able to bring on and include people in the subject or topic and not leave them behind. Equally he is a great listener and will seek advice from others where necessary.   Carl has a great dexterity of mind and can assimilate information easily, even if it is outside of his normal comfort zone. Finally, he is a great person to work with as he is pleasant, courteous and always willing to help others - I continue to learn a lot from Carl and heartily give him the utmost respect.",

During this time we worked together on the Technical File Remediation Program, the largest Program of DePuySynthes at the time. He was assigned to multiple Technical File Remediation Projects. It was a pleasure working with him as he is an insightful person. He denotes a strong determination to fulfill his goals whilst being very honest to others. Tasks assigned to him where always completed to full satisfaction and he often helped the teams to get out of difficult situations by thinking outside of the box. He was well respected in the development team and was known for his clear communication between the different teams. His ability to speak multiple languages fluently was very beneficial in global development projects. I can highly recommend working with him. ",

He has proven to be knowledgeable not only of our supply processes, but also of the pain points we often encounter working with clinical sites on a global scale. (This is not always a given for Supplies teams.)\n\nI apreciate that he has cultivated a whole team that has an eye for proactively addressing potential risks by increasing the robustness of our QMS, especially around vendor management processes, which is obviously a key to the success of any clinical trial. \n \nHe has also personally given trainings to me and other team members in order to ensure all are better prepared for any inspections or audits that may come up. During audits, he is able to respond to potentially tricky questions with expertise and succintness. He has suggested CAPAs to the team, which not only increase compliance, but are also feasible from a business standpoint.\n\nI would be happy to work with him again any time in the future.",

I then specialised in Quality and Compliance Management with a number of international companies across the Medical Device spectrum. In these positions I was able to combine my Engineering and Project Management expertise to establish and embed best international practice within laboratories, product development projects, design control, EHS and continuous improvement initiatives.\nDuring the course of my career, I gained in-depth knowledge of International Standards and their application -ISO 13485, ISO 9001, ISO 14971, ISO 14001, ISO 17025, OHSAS18001. In addition, I have employed various tools and methodologies to harness the talents and potential of cross-disciplinary, multicultural teams as a PRRC, Six Sigma certified Green Belt and PRINCE2 Practitioner.\nWhile focusing on technical, business and timeline challenges, I also prioritise People management. Whether it be my team, that I recruited and trained, or other stakeholders such as suppliers, business unit heads, executive boards and shareholders, I am able to communicate persuasively and clearly (bilingual in German and English), presenting and reporting on progress, risks and opportunities. In doing so I have influenced strategy and operations positively, bringing innovation, pragmatism, and collaboration to global organisations. I hope to continue on this trajectory with forward-thinking partners.\n\nQuality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skilful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives. \n\nWilliam A.

Sam is not only knowledgeable in his field but also portrays a superb quality mind-set always thinking one step ahead and looking at quality through the eyes of the customer.  Sam has significantly reduced the cost of poor quality by applying best in practice methodologies and forging partnerships at the Plants in his region.  With Sam’s ability to converse in several languages coupled with his ability to problem solve at plant level and in the boardroom, I would recommend Sam to any organization that is looking for a true Quality Professional.",

At the end of Sam’s first year, he successfully drove a positive mean shift in the quality performance, reducing ‘poor’ cost of quality by nearly thirty percent following my focus strategies for him. In the second year he reduced overall cost by an additional thirty percent. Sam accomplished this by working tenaciously with the plant teams, effective problem solving, and focusing the quality and plant managers on the KPIs.\n\nHe has proven his ability to problem solve, follow up and resolve systemic and pervasive issues.\nAs an Electrical Engineer with an accomplished career, he has a very good technical aptitude\nand is process oriented. He learns new products and processes quickly, and navigates\nenvironments just as effectively.\n\nSam is dependable and I have come to regard him as my ’right hand’.

For 3 years, cultural change and internal quality improvement were 2 main drivers resulting in -25% of COPQ in 2023.\nAfter a year spent in an awesome family project travelling throughout Americas, I am ready for new challenges at Morand Constructions Metalliques.
